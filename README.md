Here's a brief overview of each game:

1. **Snake and Ladder Game:**
   - Players take turns rolling dice and move through a grid with snakes and ladders.
   - The game displays the board after each roll and indicates the position of each player.
   - If a player lands on a ladder, they climb up, and if they land on a snake, they slide down.
   - The game continues until one of the players reaches the final position.

2. **Adventure Game:**
   - The player enters their name and starts with initial health and attack values.
   - The player and a monster take turns attacking each other.
   - The player can choose to attack or defend.
   - The outcome of attacks and defenses is determined randomly.
   - The game continues until either the player or the monster runs out of health.

3. **Number Guessing Game:**
   - The player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 1000.
   - The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
   - The player continues guessing until they correctly identify the number.
   - The program keeps track of the number of guesses.

Additionally, the program writes the results of each game to a file named "Games.txt," including player names and whether they won or lost.
